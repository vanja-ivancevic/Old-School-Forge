# Old School Shandalar Deck &amp; Balance Patch

This patch updates various decks, enemy rewards, shop inventories, and configuration files for the Shandalar campaign in Forge to be limited to only old-border editions up to 27. May 2003 (Scourge).

**Note:** This is a patch for the main Forge Shandalar adventure game, which can be found here: [https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge)

**Tested Version:** This patch has been tested and is intended for **forge-2.0.03**. Compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

## How to Install

1.  **Download:** Download the `.zip` file attached to the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/vanja-ivancevic/Old-School-Forge/releases).
2.  **Unzip:** Unzip the downloaded file. This will create a folder named something like `Old-School-Forge-vX.Y.Z`.
3.  **Copy Folder:** Copy this entire unzipped folder into your main Forge game directory (the one containing the `res` folder).
4.  **Navigate & Run Script:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        *   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
        *   Navigate *into* the patch folder you just copied using the `cd` command.
        *   Run the script by typing: `apply_patch_win.bat` and press Enter.
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        *   Open a Terminal window.
        *   Navigate *into* the patch folder you just copied using the `cd` command.
        *   Make the script executable (only needed once): `chmod +x apply_patch_mac.sh`
        *   Run the script: `./apply_patch_mac.sh` (or `sh apply_patch_mac.sh`)
5.  **Verify:** The script will print messages indicating which files and folders are being copied. Check for any error messages.
6.  **Launch Forge:** Start Forge and launch a new game.
