# Old-School Shandalar Forge Conversion Patch

This patch updates Forge's Shandalar campaign to only use old-border cards (from Alpha through Scourge - May 2003). It modifies:
- Card restrictions to only allow old-border sets
- Enemy decks for an authentic old-school experience
- Shop inventories 
- Rewards and configurations

**Note:** This is a patch for the main Forge Shandalar adventure game, which can be found here: [https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge)

All enemy decks have been reimagined for this old-school experience! The initial decklists were developed by a complex multi-AI-agent framework, and continue to be refined through playtesting. At least 30-40 decks have been manually reviewed and improved - including all the boss decks.

**Tested Version:** This patch has been tested and is intended for **forge-2.0.03**. Compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

## Features

- Boosters available in shops for all old-border sets (except Alpha, Beta, Unlimited and Revised)
- Power 9 cards are extremely rare and only obtainable from bosses
- Dual lands are challenging but satisfying to acquire
- Authentic old-school Magic feeling with only pre-modern frame cards

## How to Install

### Option 1: Using Installation Scripts (Recommended)

1. **Download:** Download the `.zip` file from the latest release on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/vanja-ivancevic/Old-School-Forge/releases).

2. **Extract:** Extract the ZIP file into your main Forge game directory (the folder that contains the `forge.jar` file or Forge executable and the `res` folder).

3. **Run the Installation Script:**
   
   **For Windows Users:**
   - Double-click the `apply_patch_win.bat` file
   - A command window will open showing the patching progress
   - When finished, press any key to close the window

   **For Mac/Linux Users:**
   - Open Terminal
   - Navigate to the extracted folder using: `cd "path/to/extracted/folder"`
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x apply_patch_mac.sh`
   - Run the script: `./apply_patch_mac.sh`

4. **Launch Forge:** Start Forge and begin a new Shandalar adventure game!

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually or encounter any issues with the scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Extract:** Download and extract the ZIP file to any location.

2. **Copy Files:** You'll need to copy the following files to your Forge installation:

   - Copy `config.json` to: `YOUR_FORGE_FOLDER/res/adventure/common/`
   - Copy all contents of the `decks` folder to: `YOUR_FORGE_FOLDER/res/adventure/common/decks/`
   - Copy `rewards/enemies.json` to: `YOUR_FORGE_FOLDER/res/adventure/common/world/`
   - Copy `shops/shops.json` to: `YOUR_FORGE_FOLDER/res/adventure/Shandalar/world/`

   Note: Replace `YOUR_FORGE_FOLDER` with the actual path to your Forge installation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Script fails to run:** Make sure you have proper permissions to write to your Forge directory.
- **Mac users:** If you see "Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" message, right-click the script and select "Open" instead of double-clicking.
- **Files not copied:** Try the manual installation method instead.
- **Game doesn't load:** Verify you've installed the patch on a compatible version of Forge.

## Development Status

âœ… Completed:
- Global set and card restrictions
